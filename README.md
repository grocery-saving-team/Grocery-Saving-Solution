# 🥕 Data-Driven Retail Insights (Instacart)
### Cost Savings & Revenue Growth through Machine Learning

This project analyzes the Instacart Online Grocery Basket dataset (3M+ orders, 200K+ users) to extract actionable retail intelligence using Exploratory Data Analysis, Association Rule Mining (FP-Growth), Customer Segmentation, and Revenue Simulation.

The objective is not only to understand customer behavior, but to quantify the financial impact of applying these insights in a real retail environment.

## 📌 Project Scope

This project follows a complete retail analytics pipeline:

### 🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Order distribution by weekday and hour  
- Product distribution by aisle and department  
- Customer order frequency  
- Purchase behavior per user  

### 💰 2. Synthetic Pricing Integration
- Generated synthetic product prices (dataset has no price data)  
- Enabled revenue estimation and financial simulations  

### 🛒 3. Association Rule Mining (FP-Growth)
- Frequent itemsets using **FP-Growth**  
- Key metrics: **Support, Confidence, Lift**  
- Product relationships analyzed by department and aisle  
- Identification of high-lift bundle opportunities  

### 🧠 4. Customer Segmentation
- Sparse binary encoding of orders  
- **TruncatedSVD** for dimensionality reduction  
- **MiniBatchKMeans** for clustering  
- Segment profiling by department preference  

### 📈 5. Revenue & Pricing Simulation
- Revenue estimation using synthetic prices  
- Simulation of:
  - Bundle-driven revenue growth  
  - Cross-selling impact  
  - Promotion efficiency  
- Financial comparison between baseline and optimized strategy

## 📊 Instacart Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard presenting four core analytics views:

- ⏰ **Busiest Hours** – Peak shopping time distribution  
- 📅 **Busiest Days** – Weekly order trends  
- 📊 **Customer Segment Distribution** – Order volume by cluster  
- 🏬 **Segment Department Profile** – Department preferences by segment  

The dashboard translates machine learning outputs into clear, business-ready visual insights.
